Here is a list of things I recently learned. they might not be much, but they are certainly nice tricks to have up your sleeve (or in your mind) whenever you're writing some function or job.

* For Comprehension
* Plant UML for cooler more readable docs
* Logical diagram in code doc
* Test coverage and test patterns

In time this list will grow with all the new things I am contently learning.
