I've always been a fan of learning by doing...

Here I will list all the projects I have in mind. They will mostly be small, easy to complete projects that will allow me to see different aspects of development.

Once implemented, I will add a blog post detailing the project and a link to the Github repo.

## Projects

* Instagram Heat Map: Similar to Github Heat-map, but instead of commits, we'll be tracking selfies and food posts...
* `Ok... I need to figure the rest out...`
