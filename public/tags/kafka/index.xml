      <description>Ive been recently asked to write healthchecks for long running services that depend on kafka.
This article will not go into the need for healthchecks nor a &amp;ldquo;let it crash&amp;rdquo; design. Instead I&amp;rsquo;ll delve into the struggle I had to actually write those healthchecks and more specifically checking the status of our kafka brokers.
Its important to note that I do not have an in-depth knowledge of the inner workings of kafka, and this might have probably contributed to the difficulty I found implementing said healthchecks.</description>
