      <description>The Professional Scrum Master Certification level 1 is one of those easy certifications you can easily obtain by reading a little bit about scrum and doing a couple mock tests.
This article will compile a list of useful resources that will help learn more about the scrum framework and eventually pass the certification.
I highly suggest reading the official scrum guide. It is short and simple to read. With that said I will outline below the most important parts of each section and then mention important points to keep in mind while passing the scrum certification.</description>
